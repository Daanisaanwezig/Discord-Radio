# Welcome to Discord Radio contributing guide
Thanks for showing interest in this project! By contributing to this project you are helping out Discord server owners that seek a easy to use and open source alternative to the music bots.

## Reporting bugs or making a feature request
Noticed something odd or want to request a feature?
Awesome, let's make the bot even better!

First of all make sure to check out [the current issues](https://github.com/Daanisaanwezig/Discord-Radio/issues) to make sure your bug or feature isn't already on the list, if it isn't feel free to create a new issue.

For bugs please stick to the template below:
```
### Current behavior
Brief explanation on what the bot currently does

### Expected behavior
A explanation on what you think the bot should have done.

### How to reproduce this bug
All the steps needed to reproduce this bug, please try to be as specific as possible here.
```

For feature requests please use the template below:
```
### Feature request
A explanation on what you want to be added or changed and how that will improve the bot.
```

Providing more information than currently in the template is fine, but please make sure to at least include everything mentioned in the template to make implementing a new feature or fixing a bug easier.

If you are requesting something that is neither a bug or feature request you can still create a new issue, just be sure to provide enough information so that other people know and understand what you want.

## Contributing
Want to work on the project? Feel free to do so, issues that are free to be taken can be recognized by the status [Status: Open](https://github.com/Daanisaanwezig/Discord-Radio/labels/Status%3A%20Open).
If you are picking up a issue make sure to write a comment on that issue saying that you want to work on it, this makes it clear to other developers that you want to work on it.

When writing code please make sure to add a brief explanation of what you are doing in comments, don't do this for every line of code but rather every block of code or function, this makes it easier for other developers to work on that code later down the line.

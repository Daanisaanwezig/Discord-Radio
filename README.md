# Discord-Radio [Work In Progress]
Bring back the music to Discord

With Youtube preventing Discord bots from playing their music it is time to come with a good open source alternative, your own radio station in your Discord server!

## How does it work?
Discord-Radio allows you to upload a list of songs to a folder which can be played at any given moment by simply running a command, this will rule out the need of any dependencies making it more reliable future proof!

## How can I use it?
Not yet, but the bot is getting the needed love and attention to become a reality in the near future! Check out [how-to-host.md](https://github.com/Daanisaanwezig/Discord-Radio/blob/main/how-to-host.md) for a tutorial on self-hosting the bot.
